# Why should I use your fork? What's the point of it?
I made this fork to prevent errors being thrown when compiling/running Friday Night Funkin'.
This fork is the exact same as the original [polymod repository](https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod), except reverted to an old commit that doesn't break everything.
The only other difference is this explanation file here. Other than that, I've made no changes. If you don't believe me, you may check the source code yourself, or check the [commit history](https://github.com/AngelDTF/haxe-polymod/commits/master).
